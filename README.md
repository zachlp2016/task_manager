CRUD in Rails
What does CRUD (in the the programming world) stand for?

C: Create
R: Read
U: Update
D: Delete
The apps that you will be creating in Mod 2 will make heavy use of these four actions.

Let's use Rails to build an application where we can manage some tasks.

We're going to follow the MVC design pattern, which Rails uses by default, to implement the CRUD actions for our Task Manager app. For a quick explanation of MVC, please read through this post.

Throughout the module, we'll talk through some conventions and best practices, but for now - we'd like for you to follow along with this tutorial. We highly recommend not copying and pasting the code in this tutorial. It's to your advantage to type each line of code on your own.

Getting Configured
Before creating our new Task Manager app, let's make sure we are all on the same version of Rails. For this tutorial, you will want to be running Rails 5.1.x. To check which version of rails you have installed, run $ rails -v. If you see any version other than 5.1.x, you will need to follow these instructions to get the correct version installed.

After confirming that you are running the correct version of rails, we are ready to get started!

To create your rails app, navigate to your 2module directory and run the following command:

$ rails new task_manager -T -d="postgresql"

Let's break down this command to better understand what is happening. rails new is the command to create a new Rails app - this will create a lot of directories and files; we will explore this file structure in a moment. task_manager is going to be the name of the directory in which our Rails app lives and is, essentially, the name of our application. -T tells Rails that we are not going to use its default testing suite. During the module, we will be using a new testing framework, RSpec, and will save that for class time. -d="postgresql" tells Rails that we will be using a postgresql database; Rails can handle many different databases, but this is the one we will be using in Mod2.

Now that we have created our rails app, let's cd task_manager and explore some of the structure that Rails builds out for us.

Project Folder Structure
source: imgur.com

Taking a look at the files that rails creates can be a bit overwhelming at first, but don't worry - this tutorial will only touch on a handful of directories! The top level directories that we are concered with are:

app - This is where our MVC structure lives.
config - Inside this directory, in the routes.rb file is where we will tell our Rails app which HTTP requests to respond to.
db - Where our database structure will be set up.
In addition to these directories, we will also be dealing with our Gemfile, which is where we will tell Rails about any other gems we might need to run our app. For our task manager we will be adding just one gem to our Gemfile. Open your gemfile and add pry to the :development, :test group - your Gemfile should now look like this:

source 'https://rubygems.org'

git_source(:github) do |repo_name|
  repo_name = "#{repo_name}/#{repo_name}" unless repo_name.include?("/")
  "https://github.com/#{repo_name}.git"
end

end

# Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
Any time we update our Gemfile, we will need to tell our application to install or update the additional gems. In your terminal, run the command:

$ bundle install
Great - now we can use binding.pry anywhere in our app to debug as we go!

Getting the App Running
Before we can see what our new rails app can do, we will need to get our server up and running and ready for HTTP requests. To do this, run either

rails server or rails s

You should see something like this:

=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.1.7 application starting in development
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Version 3.12.1 (ruby 2.4.1-p111), codename: Llamas in Pajamas
* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
* Environment: development
* Listening on tcp://localhost:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and you should see some Rails magic!

Now, let's take a look back at your terminal and walkthrough what just happened.

Started GET "/" for ::1 at 2019-04-13 14:38:02 -0600
Processing by Rails::Welcome#index as HTML
  Rendering /Users/meganmcmahon/.rbenv/versions/2.4.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/railties-5.1.7/lib/rails/templates/rails/welcome/index.html.erb
  Rendered /Users/meganmcmahon/.rbenv/versions/2.4.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/railties-5.1.7/lib/rails/templates/rails/welcome/index.html.erb (2.6ms)
Completed 200 OK in 254ms (Views: 9.1ms)
On the first line, you are seeing a snapshot of the HTTP request that was received by our server when we navigated to localhost:3000 - GET "/". This is basically telling us that our application received a request for the information that lives at a certain address.

On the last line, we can see a snapshot of the response that our server sent back to the browser Completed 200 OK. Meaning, we received a request, were able to process that request and succesfully send back a response. The response is what contains the information that allows the browser to render the page for Yay! You're on Rails!

Using Views
Let's update our app to show something other than the default Rails welcome - this is, after all, your app!

The first thing we need to do, is tell our app how to handle specific requests, we will do this by adding the following code to our config/routes.rb file:

# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  get '/', to: 'welcome#index'
end
This line that we added is telling our application that anytime we receive a GET request for the URI '/', we should perform the index action within our welcome controller. If this sentence was complete nonsense to you, go back and review How the Web Works and Intro to MVC. If you don't feel like you have a full grasp on exactly what is going on here, that's ok, we will be reiterating and practicing these concepts throughout the Mod.

Go back to your browser and refresh the page - you should now be seeing an error telling you that you have a Routing Error; specifically, that you have an uninitialized constant WelcomeController. This is a good thing; at this point, we have told our application which controller action to perform when this request is received, but we haven't created that controller (or the action) yet. So, let's go do that.

Open your app/controllers directory and create a file inside called welcome_controller.rb. In that file, add the following code (remember that it is strongly recommended that you not copy/paste, but practice typing out this code).

# app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb

class WelcomeController < ApplicationController


end
Go back to your browser and refresh the page again. You should now be seeing a new error The action 'index' could not be found for WelcomeController. Rails is telling us that it was able to get to the controller that we wanted, but wasn't able to find the action that we had specified for this request. Update your welcome_controller.rb to include this action:

# app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb

class WelcomeController < ApplicationController
  def index

  end
end
Refresh the page again. New error! You should now see the following text (with some additional info): WelcomeController#index is missing a template for this request. Rails is telling us that now it was able to find the controller and action we wanted, but once there, it didn't know what information to send back to the browser in the response body. It was expecting to find some HMTL that it could send back for the browser to render, but it found nothing. Let's go create that HTML in our views directory.

In your app/views directory, add a sub-directory called welcome and, within that directory, a file called index.html.erb. When creating views, we name the files the same as our action: def index to index.html.erb. And, those files will live in a directory with the same name as our controller: WelcomeController to views/welcome/. The path for your new file should be app/views/welcome/index.html.erb.

In that file, add the following HTML:

<h1>Welcome to the Task Manager</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/tasks">Task Index</a></li>
  <li><a href="/tasks/new">New Task</a></li>
</ul>
We have an h1 tag for our welcome message, then an unordered list (ul) with two list items (li) inside. If you are unfamiliar with HTML tags, try one of the HTML tutorials before continuing.

Inside of each li tag, we have an a tag. The href of the tag is the path where the link will go. In the first a tag, the path will be http://localhost:3000/tasks. The second path will be http://localhost:3000/tasks/new.

Refresh your browser and you should now see an error-free view! What do you think will happen if you click on one of these links? More errors - but that's ok! We can use these errors to help guide us in our development.

Adding a Task Index
From the home page of your app (localhost:3000/), click on the link for Task Index. You should see an error telling you that No route matches [GET] "/tasks". Our app received a request that it was not set up to handle, so let's change that!

First we need to update our config/routes.rb to handle a GET '/tasks' request. Update your routes.rb file to include the following:

# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  get '/', to: 'welcome#index'
  get '/tasks', to: 'tasks#index'
end
Thinking back to the welcome page that we created, what are our next steps to get this route to work properly? In order to display an error free view, we will need to add a TasksController, an index action in that controller, and an index.html.erb file for that controller action.

First, add a new controller to your controllers directory called tasks_controller.rb

# app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb

class TasksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @tasks = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3']
  end
end
Now, we have a Tasks Controller with an index action that is holding on to a list of tasks in our instance variable @tasks. Rails allows us to set up instance variables in our controllers to send information down to our views. To see this in action, let's create a new view: app/views/tasks/index.html.erb and put the following code inside:

<%= @tasks %>
Wait, what's this new <%= %> syntax? This is called an erb tag - erb stands for 'embedded ruby'. A combination of our file format .html.erb and the use of these tags allows us to execute ruby code directly in our html files. erb tags have access to any instance variables created in our controller action, so thats how we are able to access @tasks. Refresh your page and you will see your array displayed as... an array. Let's add some more formatting to our view:

<h1>All Tasks</h1>

<% @tasks.each do |task| %>
  <h3><%= task %></h3>
<% end %>
Remember, with erb tags, we can run any Ruby code, including an .each! Notice how the each/end is in a slightly different erb tag, <% %>, that doesn't have the =. The difference between the two is that <%= %> will echo (or display) the return value of the ruby commands in your view, and the <% %> will not echo (or display) the return value of the ruby commands. So, in the view that we just created, we do want the user to see the return value of each task in a h3 tag, but we do not want the user to see the return value of the each method. Try to change the tag for the each to <%= %> and see what happens (make sure to change it back).

Refresh your browser and check that our tasks are showing up - our index view is in ok shape now.

Adding New Tasks
We need a route that will bring a user to a form where they can enter a new task. This is the second link we had on our welcome page. In our routes.rb file:

# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  get '/', to: 'welcome#index'
  get '/tasks', to: 'tasks#index'
  get '/tasks/new', to: 'tasks#new'
end
And then in our tasks controller:

# app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb

class TasksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @tasks = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3']
  end

  def new
  end
end
In this case, we don't need an instance variable, we just need to render the new view, so we can leave the method as is!

And now we will create a new view for tasks/new.html.erb and include the following:

<form action="/tasks" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
  <p>Enter a new task:</p>
  <input type='text' name='task[title]'/><br/>
  <textarea name='task[description]'></textarea><br/>
  <input type='submit'/>
</form>
Here we have a form with an action (url path) of /tasks and a method of post. This combination of path and verb will be important when we create the route, controller and action. We then have an text input field for the title, a textarea for the description, and a submit button.

side note: You may be wondering about this form_authenticity_token business - don't worry about this now; it has to do with security protocols in Rails. If you are super curious, take that line out and see what happens - then come back and put that line back in when your form no longer works!

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/tasks/new to see your beautiful form!

Try clicking the submit button. You should get a No route matches [POST] "/tasks" error because we haven't set up a route in our app to handle this method/action (POST '/tasks') combination from the form submission.

In our routes.rb:

# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html

  get '/', to: 'welcome#index'

  get '/tasks', to: 'tasks#index'
  get '/tasks/new', to: 'tasks#new'
  post '/tasks', to: 'tasks#create'
end
And in our tasks_controller.rb:

# app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb

class TasksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @tasks = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3']
  end

  def new
  end

  def create
  end
end
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/tasks/new and fill in the form that you see there, and click on 'Submit'. What happened? Is this what you expected? Based on our form setup, when we click 'Submit', we are sending a new request to our app POST '/tasks'. This request will first hit our routes.rb file, where Rails will use the route that we set up as POST '/tasks', to: "tasks#create" to perform the create action in our tasks controller. Up to now, when we have asked Rails to perform any actions for which there is no view set up, we have seen an error indicating that there is no view for a specific action. Why did we not see this error when submitting our form? Rails is set up to try to anticipate our needs as web developers and will often provide some default functionality, that we commonly refer to as Rails Magic; and that is what is happening here! Let's dig in a bit more to what Rails is doing when we click on this submit button.

Check out your terminal and you should see something like this:

Started POST "/tasks" for ::1 at 2019-04-14 10:16:44 -0600
Processing by TasksController#create as HTML
  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"gJrDRQi8ksOkq1BdhqIDX6z2rFJGbDY4dJzuv2WZuFIU0TRWocSvyQHdbRlGmtvpMNRybXlHn4imyYAwTaWekg==", "task"=>{"title"=>"New Task", "description"=>"This is a new task!"}}
No template found for TasksController#create, rendering head :no_content
Completed 204 No Content in 94ms
On the first line, we see that our app received a request to POST to '/tasks'. As our app started trying to handle this request, we eventually got to a point where there was no HTML to render, so Rails attempted to smooth over our user's experience by sending back a response indicating that there is no content in the response. We see this on the second to last line above No template found for TasksController#create, rendering head :no_content. And, instead of throwing an error, Rails has resolved this response with a successful status code: Completed 204 No Content.

The reason that Rails has provided this magic for us, instead of throwing an error, is because Rails is assuming that when any new record is created, we will want to redirect our user's to some new place where they can see this change in place. Rails will assume that for any POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE request, we will want to send a redirect in our response. So, for these requests and their controller actions, Rails will not error if there is no corresponding HTML in our views folder!

Now let's get back to actually creating this new task. Looking back at our terminal output from submitting the form, there is a bunch of stuff right in the middle that we have not yet discussed. Specifically, let's take a look at the parameters: section of the output:

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"gJrDRQi8ksOkq1BdhqIDX6z2rFJGbDY4dJzuv2WZuFIU0TRWocSvyQHdbRlGmtvpMNRybXlHn4imyYAwTaWekg==", "task"=>{"title"=>"New Task", "description"=>"This is a new task!"}}
Looking through this information, there are a few things we will want to focus on. First, the basic structure of the parameters should look familiar - it looks like a Hash! We will be able to work with these parameters in much the same way we worked with Hashes in Mod1. Additionally, this parameters 'hash' includes the information that we sent in through our form as a nested hash with the key of 'task' and a value that looks like a hash with key/value pairs that match up with our form fields and the information that we (as a user) sent in when we submitted the form.

Let's take a look at how we can access this information from inside our application. Throw a pry in your create action so that your controller looks like this:

class TasksController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @tasks = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3']
  end

  def new
  end

  def create
    binding.pry
  end
end
Now, go back to your browser and click on 'Submit' again, then open your terminal, and you should be in a pry session that looks like this:

Started POST "/tasks" for ::1 at 2019-04-14 10:40:54 -0600
Processing by TasksController#create as HTML
  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"gJrDRQi8ksOkq1BdhqIDX6z2rFJGbDY4dJzuv2WZuFIU0TRWocSvyQHdbRlGmtvpMNRybXlHn4imyYAwTaWekg==", "task"=>{"title"=>"New Task", "description"=>"This is a new task!"}}

From: /Users/meganmcmahon/turing/staff/1901M2/task_manager/app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb @ line 10 TasksController#create:

     9: def create
 => 10:   binding.pry
    11: end

 [1] pry(#<TasksController>)>
Type in params to see some more Rails magic:

     9: def create
 => 10:   binding.pry
    11: end

[1] pry(#<TasksController>)> params

=> <ActionController::Parameters {"authenticity_token"=>"gJrDRQi8ksOkq1BdhqIDX6z2rFJGbDY4dJzuv2WZuFIU0TRWocSvyQHdbRlGmtvpMNRybXlHn4imyYAwTaWekg==", "task"=>{"title"=>"New Task", "description"=>"This is a new task!"}, "controller"=>"tasks", "action"=>"create"} permitted: false>
Rails has taken the parameters that we received in this request and turned it into a params object that we can use and manipulate inside of our application! Play around with this params object to get the two pieces of information we need for our new task - 'title' and 'description'.

[2] pry(#<TasksController>)> params["task"]
=> <ActionController::Parameters {"title"=>"New Task", "description"=>"This is a new task!"} permitted: false>

[3] pry(#<TasksController>)> params["task"]["title"]
=> "New Task"

[4] pry(#<TasksController>)> params["task"]["description"]
=> "This is a new task!"

[5] pry(#<TasksController>)> params[:task]
=> <ActionController::Parameters {"title"=>"New Task", "description"=>"This is a new task!"} permitted: false>

[6] pry(#<TasksController>)> params[:task][:title]
=> "New Task"

[7] pry(#<TasksController>)> params[:task][:description]
=> "This is a new task!"
Taking a look at the commands and their results above, can you spot a difference between the Hashes that you worked with in Mod1 and the params object that rails builds for us?

When working with a Ruby Hash, we use the key exactly as it is created in order to access the value at that location - if a key is set up as a String, we must use a String to access the value. But, with our Rails params object, we can use either a String or a Symbol to access values of a specific key. At this point, it is important to understand this only because it is conventional to use a symbol to access these values, and that is what we will be doing for this tutorial, and in Mod2.

Go back to your terminal and exit your pry session to complete the response we interrupted:

[8] pry(#<TasksController>)> exit
No template found for TasksController#create, rendering head :no_content
Completed 204 No Content in 410840ms
Saving Tasks
So we're able to get information in from our form, but we haven't really done much with it yet. It would be great if we could save it somewhere...

Our Approach
Let's think for a little bit about what we'd like to do with these task params that we're getting when our form is submitted. Really what we want to do here is create a new task using those parameters, and then save it somewhere that we can retrieve it (like a database!).

For now, let's ignore the particulars of that problem. We're going to program with enough faith in ourselves that we can figure those things out when we get to them.

I'm sure we could figure out a way to do everything we needed to do in this file, but right now, as a programmer with some OO background, sitting in my controller, thinking about creating and saving new tasks makes me wish that I had some sort of Task class that I could use to create Task objects.

Creating a Task Class (Model)
Let's change the code inside of our controller to use this Task class that we're thinking about creating. If it were up to me (and it is), I would create a new task with my task params and then save it so that I could find it later. Let's assume that we're going to create a class that does just that. Let's update our create action in our tasks controller:

  def create
    task = Task.new({
      title: params[:task][:title],
      description: params[:task][:description]
      })

    task.save

    redirect_to '/tasks'
  end
You'll sometimes see this I'm-going-to-assume-I-have-a-thing-that-works approach referred to as "top-down" programming. For an awesome video demonstration take a look at this when you have a moment. The opposite approach would be "bottom-up" where we start with the smallest piece that we can get to work and start building on it. Both are totally valid.

In order to follow MVC conventions, we are going to create this Task class in a app/models/task.rb file. In that file, create a Task class that looks like this:

# app/models/task.rb

class Task < ApplicationRecord

end
Why inherit from ApplicationRecord? This Task class that we are creating is meant to be a very specific and specialized class that we refer to as a Model. The purpose of Models is to create objects based on records that exist in a database. Rails give us some methods that we can use to help in this creation and we inherit those methods from ApplicationRecord. Two of the methods that we inherit are ::new and #save, which is great because these are two methods that we are calling in our tasks controller!

When we use the new method, Rails is going to attempt to create an object with attributes that match up to column names that exist in a tasks table in our database; and, when we attempt to save that object, Rails will try to INSERT a new record in our database with those attributes. Can you see where we might run into problems? We haven't set up our database yet, much less any tables in that database!

Creating Our Database
To create our database and connect it to our rails application, go back to your terminal and shut down your server if it is still running, with ctrl+c. Then run the following command:

$ rails db:create
You should see the following output:

Created database 'task_manager_development'
Created database 'task_manager_test'
Great, now our database is created! But, we don't have any tables yet.

Migrating to our Database
We could potentially create a tasks table directly from our terminal, but that's no fun, and it makes it pretty difficult to work with other people. Instead, let's create some migrations.

Migrations allow you to evolve your database structure over time. Each migration includes instructions to make some change to the database (e.g. adding a table, adding columns to a table, dropping a table, etc.). One advantage to this approach is that it will allow you to transfer the application to different computers without transferring the whole database. This isn't a big problem for us now, but as your database grows it will be advantageous to be able to transfer the instructions to create the database instead of the database itself.

To create a migration that will send instructions to create a tasks table to our database, run the following command from your terminal:

$ rails g migration CreateTask title:string description:string
In this command, we are telling rails to generate g a migration file that will create a tasks table in our database with two columns - title and description. To see the migration that rails created, open your db/migrate directory, and you should have a file in there that is called something like db/migrate/20190414173402_create_task.rb. Open that file and you will see the following:

class CreateTask < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :tasks do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :description
    end
  end
end
So, now we have a migration with some instructions to tell our database to create a tasks table, but how do we actually get the table created? Run the following in your terminal:

$ rails db:migrate
And you should see something like this:

== 20190414173402 CreateTask: migrating =======================================
-- create_table(:tasks)
   -> 0.0102s
== 20190414173402 CreateTask: migrated (0.0102s) ==============================
Great! How can we verify that worked?

In your terminal, connect to the database that we just created, and see if we can select some information from our tasks table:

$ psql -d task_manager_development
psql (10.1)
Type "help" for help.

task_manager_development=# SELECT * FROM tasks;

 id | title | description
----+-------+-------------
(0 rows)
Awesome - we have a database with a table for tasks! No records yet, but that's ok - all we needed to know was that our database is up a configured correctly.

To exit psql, use \q

Writing to our Database
Now that we have our Task model created and our database ready to hold on to new tasks, lets start up our server again by running rails s and let's put three binding.pry's in our tasks controller's create action so that it looks like this:

  def create
    binding.pry
    task = Task.new({
      title: params[:task][:title],
      description: params[:task][:description]
      })
    binding.pry
    task.save
    binding.pry
    redirect_to '/tasks'
  end
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/tasks/new, fill out our form, and click 'Submit'. In our terminal, we should have hit our first pry - let's make sure we have access to the information we need to create a new task:

     9: def create
 => 10:   binding.pry
    11:   task = Task.new({
    12:     title: params[:task][:title],
    13:     description: params[:task][:description]
    14:     })
    15:   binding.pry
    16:   task.save
    17:   binding.pry
    18:   redirect_to '/tasks'
    19: end

[1] pry(#<TasksController>)> params
=> <ActionController::Parameters {"authenticity_token"=>"0rLX4XBsN20goM2Y/vLS2EnV1nxts9r0s6XCBXyFaclG+SDy2RQKZ4XW8Nw+ygpu1fcIQ1KYc0Rh8KyKVLlPCQ==", "task"=>{"title"=>"new", "description"=>"task"}, "controller"=>"tasks", "action"=>"create"} permitted: false>

[2] pry(#<TasksController>)> params[:task]
=> <ActionController::Parameters {"title"=>"new", "description"=>"task"} permitted: false>
Looks good, let's exit to hit our next pry and see what task looks like at this point:

     9: def create
    10:   binding.pry
    11:   task = Task.new({
    12:     title: params[:task][:title],
    13:     description: params[:task][:description]
    14:     })
 => 15:   binding.pry
    16:   task.save
    17:   binding.pry
    18:   redirect_to '/tasks'
    19: end

[1] pry(#<TasksController>)> task
=> #<Task:0x007fdce2660eb0 id: nil, title: "New Task", description: "This is a new task!">
We have a Task object! We can see that it has a title and a description, but no id; this is telling us that Rails was able to create the object, but has not yet saved it in the database. Let's exit to hit our next pry and see if anything changes.

     9: def create
    10:   binding.pry
    11:   task = Task.new({
    12:     title: params[:task][:title],
    13:     description: params[:task][:description]
    14:     })
    15:   binding.pry
    16:   task.save
 => 17:   binding.pry
    18:   redirect_to '/tasks'
    19: end

[1] pry(#<TasksController>)> task
=> #<Task:0x007fdce2660eb0 id: 1, title: "New", description: "Task">
Now, our task has an id, indicating that it was saved in our database! Great, it looks like everything is working, so let's exit through this last pry and go check on our browser.

We are now looking at our task index again, but we don't see our new task - why is that? If we look at our index action, we are setting up an array of Strings, rather than asking our database for all the tasks that currently exist. Let's change that!

Reading from our Database
In the same way that we inherited methods to create database records, we have also inherited methods to get all records that currently exist in the database. Let's update our index action in our tasks controller to match the following:

  def index
    @tasks = Task.all
  end
Now, refresh your browser - what do you see? You are now seeing... something... but not really what we expected, right? Before, we were sending an array of strings to our view and that view was iterating over the array and creating a list of all the things in that array. It is still doing that, but now, the things that are in the array are objects, not just strings, so the way we treat them will be slightly different. Go to your index view and change it to work with task objects instead.

<h1>All Tasks</h1>

<% @tasks.each do |task| %>
  <h3><%= task.title %></h3>
  <p><%= task.description %></p>
<% end %>
Refresh your browser, and now you should see something that looks a bit nicer.

Showing Individual Tasks
Let's see if we can show some individual tasks. At this point we should be able to rely on a lot of the pieces we have already set up. At a high level we want to do the following:

Add a link to an individual task from the index
Add a route for an individual task
In our controller, find a specific task to send to a view
Create a view to show details for a specific task
Add a Link to an Individual Task
From a users perspective, it makes the most sense to have a link to each task directly from the tasks index page. Let's update our views/tasks/index.html.erb to include this link:

<h1>All Tasks</h1>

<% @tasks.each do |task| %>
  <h3><a href="/tasks/<%= task.id %>"><%= task.title %></a></h3>
  <p><%= task.description %></p>
<% end %>
Notice how we can use erb to embed ruby into html attributes. This is a very powerful feature that we will use a lot.

Now, when we visit http://localhost:3000/tasks, instead of seeing just a plain text of each tasks title, we will see that title as a link to an individual task's show page.

But that link won't work just yet!

Add a Route and Controller Action for an Individual Task
In our config/routes.rb file, add the following route:

# config/routes.rb

get '/tasks/:id', to: "tasks#show"
And in our tasks_controller.rb add a show action:

# app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb

def show

end
Add a Show View
Before we get to what will live inside this show action, let's dream up what we might want to be in our view for this action.

In our views folder, create a file for views/tasks/show.html.erb and put the following HTML inside it:

# app/views/tasks/show.html.erb

<a href="/tasks">Task Index</a>

<h1><%= @task.title %></h1>

<p><%= @task.description %></p>
Now, we have a show page that will show the information for a specific task, as well as a link back to the task index page.

Let's see if we have accomplished our goal - navigate to http://localhost:3000/tasks/1 and let's see what happens.

More errors! We should be seeing an error message telling us that we have a NoMethodError in Tasks#show, and if we look more closely, we are specifically seeing an undefined method 'title' for nil:NilClass. Thinking back to the errors we have seen in Mod1 - this is telling us that we are calling a method, title on a nil; in other words, @task is not holding on to a specific task that we can call title and description on.

Finding Specific Tasks
Let's look back at our show action in our tasks controller and see if we can set up our instance variable @task. Remember when we talked about how we are inheriting some functionality from ActiveRecord that helps us interact with our database? Well, now's a great place to take advantage of the ActiveRecord method find, which will retreive a record from our database based on that record's id. In this case, we can use find like this:

# app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb

def show
  @task = Task.find(params[:id])
end
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/tasks/1 and you should now see the show page for that particular task!

But wait - the last time we used params, we were getting information from a form. There's no form involved in this interaction, so what exactly is happening here? Let's throw a binding.pry at the top of our show action and see what we can find:

# app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb

def show
  binding.pry
  @task = Task.find(params[:id])
end
Refresh your browser and take a look at your terminal. In your pry session, call params and see what is returned.

    6: def show
 => 7:   binding.pry
    8:   @task = Task.find(params[:id])
    9: end

[1] pry(#<TasksController>)> params
=> <ActionController::Parameters {"controller"=>"tasks", "action"=>"show", "id"=>"1"} permitted: false>
We are getting a much simpler params object than when we used a form, and these params include an :id that matches with the very end of the uri we visited (/tasks/1). Looking at our routes, we see that we set up our URI pattern to accept :id, but when we visited this site, we typed in 1 which is an actual id that exists in our database. When we need to get some infomration, like an id, from our route in the form of parameters, we can include a symbol of the thing we are expecting when we set up our route - in this case, we are expecting an :id. So, based on how we set up our routes, we can manipulate and dictate what parameters we want; and what information we will need access to in our controllers.

Remember that you will need to exit your pry session to continue interacting with your site!

Editing a Task
At this point, we have an application that will allow us to visit a home page, see a list of tasks, add a task, and see a specific task. We have covered the Create and Read portions of CRUD. Now, let's add some functionality to be able to Update existing tasks.

This updating will be very similar to creating new tasks. At a high level, we will need to:

Create a button to edit a specific task
Create a route that will GET us an edit form
Add the action and views for this route
Create a route that will PATCH a specific task based on form input
Add the action that will accomplish this update and redirect the user
Add an Edit Button to the Show Page
To make our user experience as smooth as possible, let's create a link to 'Edit' a specific task - similar to the link we created to add a new task.

In our show.html.erb file, update the code to include an edit link:

<a href="/tasks">Task Index</a>

<h1><%= @task.title %></h1>

<p><%= @task.description %></p>

<a href="/tasks/<%= @task.id %>/edit">Edit</a>
Now, when a user navigates to http://localhost:3000/tasks/1, they will see a link to 'Edit'. If they click on that link, a GET request will be sent to the URI tasks/:id/edit. As of now, that route doesn't exist - let's create it!

Creating the Route, Controller Action, and View
In our config/routes.rb file, add the following route:

get '/tasks/:id/edit', to: 'tasks#edit'
And in our taks scontroller, add the following action:

def edit
  @task = Task.find(params[:id])
end
Now, we need a view! This will be similar, but not exactly the same as the view we created for the new action. We will need to create the following HTML in views/tasks/edit.html.erb:

<form action="/tasks/<%= @task.id %>" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PATCH" />
  <p>Edit</p>
  <input type='text' name='task[title]' value="<%= @task.title %>"/><br/>
  <textarea name='task[description]'><%= @task.description %></textarea><br/>
  <input type='submit'/>
</form>
The way that we have set up this form, including the @task.title and @task.description as field values, will autofill our form with the current task information, so that a user can update one or both fields and maintain any unchanged information.

Additionally, you'll notice that there's a hidden field with a value of PATCH. Normally, HTML forms only allow GET or POST requests (see more information [here])(http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_method.asp).

We're going to want this form to access a route in our controller (that we'll create momentarily) using PATCH to be consistent with conventions about the HTTP verb that is used when updating a resource (take a quick look at this table if this is new information).

HTML won't allow us to use method='patch' in our form tag, but passing it as a hidden value gives our app the information it needs to route the request correctly.

Updating a Task Resource
Now, our application will need to know what to do when someone submits the edit form, making a PATCH request to /tasks/:id; so, in our routes.config.rb, let's add the following route:

patch '/tasks/:id', to: 'tasks#update'
And in our tasks controller, let's add an update action:

def update
  task = Task.find(params[:id])
  task.update({
    title: params[:task][:title],
    description: params[:task][:description]
    })
  task.save
  redirect_to "/tasks/#{task.id}"
end
There's a lot going on here - let's break it down.

Before we can make any updates to a record in our database, we first need to find that information, which is why we are using the find method that we used on our show action. Then, we can use an ActiveRecord udpate to change the object that ActiveRecord found and created for us. Finally, we need to save the changes we made to that object in our database. And, thinking way back to when we were creating an object, Rails will expect us to redirect after making this update, so we are going to redirect back to the tasks' show page.

Now that we have this edit functionality implented, make sure you have your server running, and play around with your new fancy form!

Deleting a Task
As of now, we have the Create, Read, and Update functions done - all we are missing is Delete! At a high level we need to:

Add a button to delete a specific task
Add a route to handle the request to delete a task
Add a controller action to accomplish the delete
Add a Delete Button
We don't need a form to delete a task, but we do need to know which task we want to delete, so we'll leverage a form to create a button that will send a DELETE request to a route with our task id.

Let's add this 'button' to our tasks/index.html.erb:

<h1>All Tasks</h1>

<% @tasks.each do |task| %>
  <h3><a href="/tasks/<%= task.id %>"><%= task.title %></a></h3>
  <p><%= task.description %></p>
  <a href="/tasks/<%= task.id  %>/edit">Edit</a>
  <form action="/tasks/<%= task.id %>" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
    <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE">
    <input type="submit" value="delete"/>
  </form>
<% end %>
Now, if you take a look at our index page at http://localhost:3000/tasks, you should see a 'Delete' button for each task. But, the button will throw an error - why?

Add a Delete Route and Controller Action
When we click 'Delete' we gett an error - No route matches [DELETE] "/tasks/1". So, let's go add that route to our config/routes.rb:

delete '/tasks/:id', to: 'tasks#destroy'
And, with this route, we will need to add a destroy action to our tasks controller:

def destroy
  Task.destroy(params[:id])
  redirect_to '/tasks'
end
Another new method! We have used new, save, find, and update so far - what is destroy doing? destroy is another method we are inheriting from ActiveRecord that destroys records in our database based on an id that you send to the method.

Now, we should be able to navigate to our tasks index at http://localhost:3000/tasks and delete any of our tasks!

Finished!
Congrats! You have finished your first Rails app that can handle full CRUD functionality for a database resource! We can now Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks!

Checks for Understanding
Define CRUD.
Define MVC.
What three files would you need to create/modify for a Rails application to respond to a GET request to /tasks, assuming you have a Task model.
What are params? Where do they come from?
Check out your routes. Why do we need two routes each for creating a new Task and editing an existing Task?
